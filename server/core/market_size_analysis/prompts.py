    Market Size Analysis Report Writing Guidelines

    - Cite credible sources (industry reports, government data, research papers).
    - Use precise terminology (e.g., CAGR, market share, segments).

    2. Length and Style:

    - Support analysis with ONE structural element:
    - Either a focused table (market size by segment or region)

    - Provide at least one specific example (e.g., a company or segment driving growth).
    - Explain key assumptions briefly.
    - Avoid broad claims without supporting data.

    - Proper use of only ONE structural element.
    - Key insight stated upfront.
    - Data-backed analysis with cited sources.
